# Substitution-cipher
The Windows Forms application is designed to simplify the decryption of Russian-language text encrypted with substitution cipher.

The main window of the program displays the encrypted text (in two copies, one of which changes during decryption), an analysis of the frequency of the decrypted text and the text taken as a sample (file 2.txt; for example, the novel "War and Peace" by Leo Tolstoy is taken). Entering any characters other than the Russian alphabet into the window is prohibited.
